# Download and decompress our dataset, which is pictures of dogs and cats:

# In[ ]:


path = untar_data(URLs.PETS)/'images'


# We need a way to label our images as dogs or cats. In this dataset, pictures of cats are given a filename that starts with a capital letter:

# In[ ]:


def is_cat(x): return x[0].isupper() 


# Now we can create our `DataLoaders`:

# In[ ]:


dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_name_func('.',
    get_image_files(path), valid_pct=0.2, seed=42,
    label_func=is_cat,
    item_tfms=Resize(192))


# ... and train our model, a resnet18 (to keep it small and fast):

# In[ ]:


learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate)
learn.fine_tune(3)


# Now we can export our trained `Learner`. This contains all the information needed to run the model:

# In[ ]:


learn.export('model.pkl')


# Finally, open the Kaggle sidebar on the right if it's not already, and find the section marked "Output". Open the `/kaggle/working` folder, and you'll see `model.pkl`. Click on it, then click on the menu on the right that appears, and choose "Download". After a few seconds, your model will be downloaded to your computer, where you can then create your app that uses the model.
